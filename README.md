<h2>Small Java games and programs</h2>

<h3>Here is a list of the Java files and games currently in this repository:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>RockPaperScissors: </strong><br/>
      This is a console application of the classic Rock, Paper, Scissors game. The user selects either "Rock", "Paper", or "Scissors", and the computer also chooses one of the options. Then, the two choices are pitted against each other to see who wins. Rock wins over scissor, Scissor wins over paper or rock, and Paper wins over rock. If the user and computer select the same item, then it's a tie. <br/>
      <em>To play, simply download RockPaperScissors.java and run it using your favorite Java dev environment. Enjoy!</em>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Password_Verifier:</strong><br/>
      This application tests a password to see if it meets the requirements. Using dialog I/O, the user provides his desired password, which is automatically tested. If it meets all the requirements, the user gets a confirmation that his password has been changed. Otherwise, the user can try to input a password again. A valid password contains at least 6 characters, with at least 1 uppercase, 1 lowercase letter, and 1 digit.
